      <ul class="body-p">

        <li style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Recidivism is a constant phenomenon in the state penitentiary system, in historical average, <a style="color:rgb(213,58,58);">15% of the total income</a> was due to this cause. The crimes that affect the patrimony is the main reason why people returned to state prisons.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">The prison overcrowding in the states is a problem that remains in force even though the figures collected during 2016 indicate the decrease of the prison population by 13% compared to the existing in 2015.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">The prison staff is insufficient to care for the inmate population, since for every eight persons deprived of liberty, there is a custodial person who watches over them. This lack is more evident with respect to specialized personnel, 14% of the total prison staff of 2016 had assigned technical tasks. That is, specialized work in the field of reintegration.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">The investment in the penitentiary system of the states is marginal with respect to the total budget of the states. In addition, the expenditure destined for social reintegration is unknown.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">Despite the offer of social reintegration that the state penitentiary establishments have, the percentage of crimes for recidivism and re-admissions went from 21% to 25% from 2014 to 2015. One of the problems that hinder social reintegration is the lack of infrastructure for state prisons to provide useful occupational activities.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">The separation of people who serve a sentence from those who do not have one, continues to be a challenge for state prisons, partially, due to the lack of infrastructure for those purposes. Since there are still entities where there are no spaces for people without a sentence, which forces this population to converge with those who must serve a sentence.</li>

      <ul class="body-p">

        <li style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Design effective social reintegration strategies that guarantee that the prison population can reincorporate to be productive in our community should be a main concern of any penitentiary system.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">We propose to model our reintegration strategies on The Last Mile (TLM). It was created to provide programs that result in successful reentry and reduce recidivism. We believe that jobs are the key to breaking the cycle of incarceration. The goal is to provide marketable skills that lead to employment. The in and out program provides career training in prison with mentorship and job placement upon release.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">Through the process, they learn how businesses function, how to work with a team, accept criticism, gain confidence in their ability to grasp new ideas, and pivot when they are heading down the wrong path. With the help of volunteers, guest speakers, and leaders from the business community, they are introduced to the latest technology without access to the internet or hands on experience.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">It is predicted that there will be a shortfall of 1 million software engineering jobs in 2020. Jobs that can be fufilled by our students.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">The organization will work as an ONG and accept and work by donations.</li>

      <ul class="body-p">

        <li style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Why? UNODC warns that investing in social reintegration helps reduce the number of people who return to commit a crime, therefore, the number of victims decreases as well as increases the security in the community.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">In addition, the successful reintegration of criminals will make fewer of them appear again in the judicial courts, fewer return to prison and increase the overpopulation of jails in such a way that the benefits of this type of interventions not only affect the increase in security, but also contribute to the reduction of the cost of the penitentiary system.</li>

      <ol class="body-p" type="1">

        <li style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">How did you apply (or not) iterative design in your project?
          <ol type="a">
            <li>I applied it by thinking of an idea developing it somewhat asking for feedback and going back and making changes. This was done various times.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li class="paragraph">Explain the audience of your project. Describe the main highlights of your persona.
          <ol type="a">
            <li>My persona is someone mexican or interested in the penitentiary system here in Mexico. They are probably in highschool or college. They are doing an overview investigation on the problems and possible solutions relating to the system. Although it may just be for a class. Therefore my job is to show the ideas clearly, easily and reliable.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li class="paragraph">Create your own methodology to develop a website. It’s important to justify all the steps.
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Search: we retrieve the information from reliable sources.</li>
            <li>Condense: we make a summary of the most relevant information.</li>
            <li>Show: make it presentable to the consumer.</li>
            <li>Friendly: make sure the information and webpage is easy to navigate.</li>
            <li>Monitor: we look into new subjects or areas we might of lacked depth in.</li>
            <li>Maintain: Try and keep it up and running. Search new information and solutions.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li class="paragraph">Explain the status of your project. Grade your project according to your effort (30%) and result (70%).
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Effort: 30/30. No teammates.</li>
            <li>Result: 100/100. Perhaps I should be more humble but I think the current product looks great, not finished yet, functional and easy to use.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li class="paragraph">Explain the status of your interview. Who is your expert? Why? Who is your user?
          <ol type="a">
            <li>My interview has not yet taken place. Is my uncle and he works in government back in Guanajuato where I’m from. He is in treasury and I’m hoping to ask him about the budget that’s spend in the penitentiary system in the state of Guanajuato; which is the best ranked in the country. How much is spent in recidivism measures and if they are working on improving upon their number one status. </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li class="paragraph">Ask another team for their proposal. Compare it with yours. Which one is better? Why?
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Haven’t.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li class="paragraph">Is your project responsive? Explain.
          <ol type="a">
            <li>It works in most devices so i would say yes.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li class="paragraph">In your project did you follow the first three laws of simplicity? How?
          <ol type="a">
            <li>I made it really simple to navigate. Took out unnecessary features without it being to barebones. It’s a simple scroll format in the same window with jumps to any specific part of the reading. All in the same delineated space. It’s easy and fast to access all information.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li class="paragraph">Grade your second term (each member).
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Luis(101/100), maybe less because of homework.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
