        <li style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Recidivism is a constant phenomenon in the state penitentiary system, in historical average, 15% of the total income was due to this cause. The crimes that affect the patrimony is the main reason why people returned to state prisons.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">The prison overcrowding in the states is a problem that remains in force even though the figures collected during 2016 indicate the decrease of the prison population by 13% compared to the existing in 2015.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">The prison staff is insufficient to care for the inmate population, since for every eight persons deprived of liberty, there is a custodial person who watches over them. This lack is more evident with respect to specialized personnel, 14% of the total prison staff of 2016 had assigned technical tasks. That is, specialized work in the field of reintegration.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">The investment in the penitentiary system of the states is marginal with respect to the total budget of the states. In addition, the expenditure destined for social reintegration is unknown.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">Despite the offer of social reintegration that the state penitentiary establishments have, the percentage of crimes for recidivism and re-admissions went from 21% to 25% from 2014 to 2015. One of the problems that hinder social reintegration is the lack of infrastructure for state prisons to provide useful occupational activities.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">The separation of people who serve a sentence from those who do not have one, continues to be a challenge for state prisons, partially, due to the lack of infrastructure for those purposes. Since there are still entities where there are no spaces for people without a sentence, which forces this population to converge with those who must serve a sentence.</li>

        <li style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Design effective social reintegration strategies that guarantee that the prison population can reincorporate to be productive in our community should be a main concern of any penitentiary system.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">Why? UNODC warns that investing in social reintegration helps reduce the number of people who return to commit a crime, therefore, the number of victims decreases as well as increases the security in the community.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">In addition, the successful reintegration of criminals will make fewer of them appear again in the judicial courts, fewer return to prison and increase the overpopulation of jails in such a way that the benefits of this type of interventions not only affect the increase in security, but also contribute to the reduction of the cost of the penitentiary system.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">We propose to model our reintegration strategies on The Last Mile (TLM). It was created to provide programs that result in successful reentry and reduce recidivism. We believe that jobs are the key to breaking the cycle of incarceration. The goal is to provide marketable skills that lead to employment. The in and out program provides career training in prison with mentorship and job placement upon release.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">Through the process, they learn how businesses function, how to work with a team, accept criticism, gain confidence in their ability to grasp new ideas, and pivot when they are heading down the wrong path. With the help of volunteers, guest speakers, and leaders from the business community, they are introduced to the latest technology without access to the internet or hands on experience.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">It is predicted that there will be a shortfall of 1 million software engineering jobs in 2020.

        Jared needs to declare a major. He is leaning towards the science field, but does not want to teach and does not feel that he wants to continue with graduate school upon graduation. He has taken a number of science classes, including biology and chemistry. He enjoys math and his skills are above average. He has looked into engineering, but wonders if there might be another field that he would enjoy. Jared has good computer skills, and enjoys technology, but does not want a job that requires him to sit at a desk all day.
        Two areas that he feels an affinity for are the environment-related programs and the science programs.  He realizes that the Green movement is growing and the thought of working in this arena is appealing to him.  Recently, Jason met a Food Science major.  He was surprised to learn that it involved the science disciplines, especially chemistry and biology.  He is planning to learn more about this program. Jared lives off campus in an apartment that he shares with three other students.  He has a Facebook page and uses other social networking. He has an iphone, and considers himself tech savvy. Jared loves Penn State football games. He enjoys biking and has managed a few tours. Although he comes from a small town in Southwestern Pennsylvania, he hopes to be able to someday be working in an urban area. He feels there is much more excitement and entertainment in the cities. He is also interested in traveling and studying in other countries.
